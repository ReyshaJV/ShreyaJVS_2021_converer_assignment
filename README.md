# Krittika Convener Selections 2021
Python Assignment

I copied the original assignment repo and made this private repository. Then I downloaded the problem statement Notebook, wrote the program and uploaded it again in this repository, with the same name, *problem statement*.  
It was a really fun assignment! :)

   What to do:
1. Make a private repository, and add the Jupyter Notebook and data files
2. Fill in the required code to complete the `Problem_Statement` Jupyter Notebook.
3. Push the notebook to the `main` branch of your repository.
4. After the deadline, make your repository public (you will be given a reminder)
